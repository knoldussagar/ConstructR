# ConstructR
ConstructR is for bootstrapping (construction) an Akka cluster by using a coordination service.  Disambiguation: Despite the similar name, ConstructR is not related to Lightbend ConductR.  ConstructR utilizes a key-value coordination service like etcd to automate bootstrapping or joining a cluster. It stores each member node under the key /constructr/$clusterName/nodes/$address where $clusterName is for disambiguating multiple clusters and $address is a Base64 encoded Akka Address. These keys expire after a configurable time in order to avoid stale information. Therefore ConstructR refreshes each key periodically.  In a nutshell, ConstructR is a state machine which first tries to get the nodes from the coordination service. If none are available it tries to acquire a lock, e.g. via a CAS write for etcd, and uses itself or retries getting the nodes. Then it joins using these nodes as seed nodes. After that it adds its address to the nodes and starts the refresh loop:
